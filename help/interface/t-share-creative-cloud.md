   Once you have removed all Creative Cloud Users, the folder is unshared and the Creative Cloud users no longer has access. 

More ways to use a shared asset include: 

* Use assets in the [!UICONTROL Asset Selector] in [!DNL Adobe Social] for social posts.
* Load or swap assets in the [Offers Library](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/experiences/offers/manage-content.html?lang=en) in [!DNL Adobe Target] for images in activities.

After you share a folder to the Creative Cloud, you will see the Creative Cloud logo on the folder.
