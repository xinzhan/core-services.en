# Overview of Experience Cloud Assets

Experience Cloud Assets provide a single, centralized repository of marketing-ready assets that you can share across applications. An asset is a digital document, image, video, or audio (or part thereof) that can have multiple renditions and can have sub-assets (for example, layers in a [!DNL Photoshop] file, slides in a [!DNL PowerPoint] file, pages in a PDF, files in a ZIP).

Asset services include: 

* Asset storage, management interface, embedded selection interface (accessed through applications).
* Integrations with Creative Cloud, Experience Cloud collaboration, and Experience Cloud applications.

Using assets improves consistency and brand compliance, and speeds time to market. You can streamline workflows in applications: 

* **[!DNL Adobe Target]**: Create experiences for A/B and multivariate tests.
* **[!DNL Ad Cloud]**: Develop ad units across different channels and campaigns
* **[!DNL Adobe Campaign]**: Place assets into email newsletters and campaigns.
