**Adobe Masters Roundtable: Balancing Personalization &amp; Privacy**

In this article you&#39;ll learn how to successfully execute a data-driven personalization strategy, while navigating the complex and ever-evolving world of privacy compliance.

**Personalization &amp; Privacy - A Delicate Balancing Act**

Theory is one thing, but to put these principles into practice is another. Below, we share insights from two Adobe customers who have masterfully implemented data-driven personalization strategies and navigated what can often be a delicate transformational process within their respective organizations.

**How To Get Started**

1. **Get Stakeholder Buy-In**

&quot;When we began our personalization initiatives, I was a team of one. A pivotal moment was getting cross functional buy-in, getting members to care, and making them feel involved.&quot; – Shawn Wilkinson, Senior eCommerce Program Manager, Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods

1. **Consider &quot;the Staircase Approach&quot;** – Richard George, Global Head of Integrated Marketing, London Stock Exchange Group

- Ground Floor: No personalization
  - Even at this fundamental level you still want to provide a high-quality experience to encourage users to take further action.

- Step 1: One-to-many
  - Build more complex use cases and apply them across channels.

- Step 2: One-to-some
  - This involves data science models, reviewing existing customer information, and personalizing product messaging.

- Step 3: One-to-one or One-to-few
  - Identify where they are in the customer journey and implement individual personalization strategies.

1. **Be Agile**

&quot;You&#39;ll start with a hypothesis, then you&#39;ll pull results. But you may not be right. The important thing is to have that agile mindset; be flexible, be ready to pivot. Keep working out the details until you get to where you need to be.&quot; – Shawn Wilkinson, Senior eCommerce Program Manager, Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods

1. **Prioritize Building Trust**

&quot;Regulation isn&#39;t a choice. We have to comply. More importantly, we have to use data properly. We can&#39;t degrade trust. Trust is critical in this day and age.&quot; – Richard George, Global Head of Integrated Marketing, London Stock Exchange Group

**Leading Organizational Transformation**

When it comes to having a positive impact on your overall performance, it is crucial to consider organizational structure. Here are strategies to gain stakeholder buy-in and establish cross functional alignment.

- Share your vision &amp; demonstrate small wins

Wilkinson recommends a two-pronged approach: putting a plan together outlining vision and strategy, then teasing out incremental gains.

&quot;Create a deck on all these ideas and how you could implement them. Work with marketing, tech, ecommerce, strategy &amp; analytics teams, and get buy-in as you go. We dedicated a whole month to light, easy, quick tests, serving personalized content based on what was in season. Results were positive, and we demonstrated incremental gains. This was the green light, giving us the approval to push our personalization strategies forward.&quot; – Shawn Wilkinson, Senior eCommerce Program Manager, Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods

- Democratized data, centralize privacy compliance, and remove siloes

To avoid compliance issues, we recommend that data be managed across the organization, not just harnessed among marketing and sales teams. Consider building a team dedicated to privacy, giving your marketing and sales team peace of mind and the space to focus on their goals without worry.

&quot;Our privacy counsel is central to everything we do. We have a pragmatic set of experts who provide consistent guidance in this ever evolving sphere. Additionally, we invested in a Global Privacy Lead and now we have two people. They work hand in hand with our marketing and sales teams, balancing business needs with privacy requirements. This means our marketers don&#39;t have to worry about being compliant, they can focus more on creativity.&quot; – Richard George, Global Head of Integrated Marketing, London Stock Exchange Group

&quot;The customer data platform ([CDP](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/overview.html?lang=en)) cleanses data, adds and enriches the data, and brings it together for a customer profile. You can plug it into your personalization tools and broader journey orchestration. Ours was really about how to create experiences from the CDP. Ultimately we aimed to create more holistic, integrated experiences we couldn&#39;t do when the data and channel platforms were siloed. This was a big opportunity for us.&quot; – Richard George, Global Head of Integrated Marketing, London Stock Exchange Group

**Small Actions With Big Returns**

There are many facets to personalization strategy and even more with regard to privacy requirements. Here are three small steps that when added up have a significant impact on an organization&#39;s success.

- Be excellent, even without personalization

&quot;We try to make sure the basic experience on the site without personalization is optimized and applicable to any visitor. We don&#39;t rely on personalization to make our experience great. If you don&#39;t have it for any reason, it&#39;s important to still make sure the customer gets what they need. Then the question becomes how can you get the customer to do something to allow you to personalize their experience.&quot; – Richard George, Global Head of Integrated Marketing, London Stock Exchange Group

George also points out there is &quot;a fine line between getting personalization right and wrong. Don&#39;t ask a customer something you should already know.&quot;

- Leverage readily available data

&quot;Having many different activation points throughout our website, and homepage in particular, is key. We utilize a lot of data already available to us, not particularly private, such as website browser behavior. We have more flexibility that way.&quot; – Shawn Wilkinson, Senior eCommerce Program Manager, Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods

- Think outside the box with personalization strategies

  - Consider leveraging third parties to remain in compliance while also personalizing your customer&#39;s experience

&quot;We use a personalized gifting approach, sending gifts to our clients, managed by a third party vendor. An interesting test was defining who is the data controller and data processor in that regard. With the gifting company as the controller, that meant we had to change the experience we provided to the customer and show the customer we were providing the data to them.&quot; – Richard George, Global Head of Integrated Marketing, London Stock Exchange Group

  - Offer feedback surveys

&quot;One of my goals is to implement personalized content so subtly and streamlined, that the user doesn&#39;t even know it&#39;s happening. It just feels natural and aligns with their expectations. To see if it&#39;s working, we use feedback surveys to gauge how they feel about the personalized experiences and set KPIs to see if we are hitting the mark.&quot; – Shawn Wilkinson, Senior eCommerce Program Manager, Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods

**Personalization &amp; Privacy: Trends for 2022 and Beyond**

A common question Adobe customers ask is what to expect and how to prepare in advance. For instance, are we trending towards this exchange of data and content becoming the norm? Is there a better way to approach that value exchange? Our experts weighed in on a few trends and patterns they are focused on.

- Authentication

&quot;If you can get a customer to log in, you have to be prepared to provide a richer experience. The challenge is, can you get people authenticated? Make sure your unauthenticated content is as engaging as the authenticated content, but also give them something extra if they do log in.&quot; – Richard George, Global Head of Integrated Marketing, London Stock Exchange Group

- Loyalty

&quot;Having data available on loyal customers is crucial. We benefit significantly from looking at our logins; our users with a high sign-in rate on our mobile app. Being able to answer what customers are doing there is extremely helpful in our personalization strategy. Also, we try to figure out how to get customers to opt in. By offering personalized, relevant, valuable content and experiences, we make opting in a positive thing that increases customer satisfaction and boosts conversions.&quot; – Shawn Wilkinson, Senior eCommerce Program Manager, Dick&#39;s Sporting Goods

- Merging Experiences

&quot;Over the last several years, we have been bringing our experiences on to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). We pulled this together into a strategy we call our digital ecosystem. No matter where people come in, we provide a consistent experience with a single data layer so we can run personalization and data tracking across the experience. We started to realize things start to merge together. If we could rewind five years, we would have built those as one site. Interesting to see how experiences are starting to blend and how you can integrate them better.&quot; – Richard George, Global Head of Integrated Marketing, London Stock Exchange Group
